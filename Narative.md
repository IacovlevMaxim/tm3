**Narrative**

Our story begins with a devastating crash. The protagonist, a young astronaut and engineer, finds himself stranded on a strange, distant planet that bears an uncanny resemblance to Earth — yet everything here is unfamiliar, wild, and untamed. The skies glow a deeper shade of blue, the forests hum with strange life, and the stars above whisper of home.

Back on his native planet, his family waits anxiously. His parents remain hopeful, and his younger sister — the last to see him off — had pressed a delicate pendant into his hand before launch. *“So you don’t forget your way back,”* she had said with a smile. Now, that pendant is all he has — a memory, a promise, and a reason to survive.

To return home, the protagonist must do the impossible: repair his broken ship using the limited resources of this alien world. The process is arduous and dangerous, requiring the player to gather rare materials, unlock blueprints, and craft five critical components:

* **An engine**, powerful enough to break through the planet’s gravity
* **A rocket wing**, capable of stabilizing the flight through the atmosphere
* **Highly volatile fuel**, synthesized from strange flora and underground minerals
* **A launch catapult**, constructed to propel the ship into initial lift-off
* **A navigator**, built from salvaged parts and ancient alien technology

Each of these components is a project in itself, demanding exploration, resourcefulness, and moments of courage. As the player ventures deeper into the planet’s ecosystems, they will encounter hostile creatures — territorial beasts and nocturnal predators, remnants of a once-great biosphere now fighting for dominance. The player may choose to battle them for survival… or study them to gain advantages.

Yet not all the planet is wild.

At a pivotal point, the player may discover a cryptic riddle carved into the stone of a long-abandoned ruin. Solving it leads to a hidden valley where a small human-like **settlement** has taken root, lit only by firelight and guarded by suspicion. The villagers are wary of outsiders — but if the player earns their trust by crafting a **giant lantern**, a beacon of hope and defense against the darkness, he will be welcomed among them.

It is in this settlement that the player meets **her**.

A quiet, determined young woman with sadness in her eyes and strength in her silence. Her story slowly unfolds: once, she had nursed a wounded creature back to health, believing in compassion over control. But her father — the authoritarian leader of the settlement — saw the creature as a threat and killed it before her eyes. That day, her heart broke, and she began to dream of escape.

Now, with the arrival of the protagonist, a glimmer of that dream returns. As their bond deepens — through shared struggles, conversations by lantern light, and moments stolen beneath alien stars — the player faces a choice: repair the rocket and leave alone, or offer her a seat beside him and forge a new path together.

Either way, the journey will test not only his survival skills, but the depths of his humanity.

Will he make it home? Or will he find a new definition of “home” on the edge of the stars?
