## 1. Storyline

The protagonist crash-lands on an alien planet resembling Earth. With only a pendant from his sister and the will to return home, he must survive in a hostile environment, gather resources, and repair his damaged spaceship. To leave the planet, he needs to craft five critical components: an engine, a wing, fuel, a catapult, and a navigator. Along the way, he may discover a hidden settlement and meet a girl who longs to escape with him.

The player collects resources from the environment (e.g., minerals, flora, mechanical scraps). These are used to craft the following rocket components:

- Engine: _(Insert required resources here)_
- Wing: _(Insert required resources here)_
- Fuel: _(Insert required resources here)_
- Catapult: _(Insert required resources here)_
- Navigator: _(Insert required resources here)_

Crafting requires a nearby workbench or crafting station. Recipes become available as the player progresses through exploration and interactions with the environment.
